            <p class="section-description"> 
               We partnered up with the Che Cafe, a non-profit on UCSD’s campus, to redesign their website. 
               After building rapport, conducting research, and collaborating to construct a vision, 
               our team sifted out our site objectives.  We went through an interactive process of prototyping and usability 
               testing to create our final high-fidelity website designs for both mobile and desktop platforms. 
               We focused on branding, site architecture, and information hierarchy 
               in order to make the website attractive and accessible.

            <p class="section-description">
               We wanted the website to reflect the space. 
               Characterizing the Che Cafe Collective's brand identity as bold, inclusive, and alternative, we decided to add vibrance through visuals.
               I suggested using the colors of the rainbow to subtly hint at their queer demographic, as well as reflect aspects of their physical space, like their rainbow painted fence.
               For the typography, we chose a title font that mimicked the DIY painted text of their logo. The body font we selected had a clean but friendly look.
               We added banners to the top of each tab that contained the title, a relevant image, and a colored filter. These elements emphasized the branding look.
               We also added more pictures to the pages to give users a better idea of what the Che Cafe was all about.

            <p class="section-description">
                The original website had 13 tabs. I condensed those down to 7 main tabs with respective sub-tabs. 
                However, during our scenario-based user testing in which we asked users to locate the Gallery, we found users did not check the Archive tab.
                Because the Che Cafe is a venue, it is important that photos of the space can be located intuitively.
                Therefore, I chose to make Gallery its own tab instead of nesting it under Archive. 
                I reorganized the labeling and grouping of the tabs more effectively.

            <p class="section-description">
                The text on the pages of the website was visually dense, naturally dissuading readers.
                Yet, our client was interested in preserving the verbiage.
                Thus, we broke it up using design methods including headers, colors, drop-downs, and images.
                The poor information hierarchy on the existing website also impacted the usability in three key ways.
            </p>
            <p class="section-description">
                Firstly, the calendar serves a core function of the overall website, displaying to users what is happening at the Che and when.
                On desktop, the original calendar page had a large chunk of text to scroll past before accessing the calendar.
                We redesigned it so that the necessary information could be viewed when clicking on the event pop-ups.
                On mobile, their calendar was compressed and lacked readability.
                We changed the format to scroll vertically through cards for each day of the month with options to "jump to today" and switch month.

                Secondly, the client told us they wanted to attract more members.
                Their website communicated this with a tab labeled "Join the Collective!".
                We preserved this as a main tab to align with their goal.
                I opted to change the wording to "Get Involved", as this is more typically seen in copywriting and allows the user to approach with curiosity instead of being dissuaded but commitment.
                Our user testing also demonstrating that it was unclear how exactly to get involved.
                We clarified this by answering that question in the first line, bolding sections of text for ease in scanning, introducing a call-to-action button, and reducing the overall textual density.

                Thirdly, the general disorganization of the website made it difficult for users to understand what kind of space the Che Cafe is.
                Our client wanted to promote the message that the Che is more than just a music venue; it is a DIY space flexible for whatever people want it to be.
                Moreover, in order to book the space, the website directed users to email the client.
                To address these concerns and enhance usability, our team designed a Reservations page with an embedded Google form.
                We also added an "Upcoming Events" section to the Home page to give users a feel for what the Che offers.
                Alongside this, we created a category in the Gallery tab for non-performance events.

                Restructuring the site architecture, information hierarchy, and developing branding helped not only the functionality of the website for the users, but also met the client goals for their redesign.

            <p class="subsection-title">USER RESEARCH</p>
            <p class="section-description">
                We interviewed 11 Che Cafe visitors across a selection of events and times, 
                from daytime study hours to nighttime indie concerts, 
                and used our findings to build 3 personas that we believe capture the frequent users of the Che Cafe space. 
                We then created several scenarios and use cases that represent the activities and goals of the personae 
                in order to highlight how potential users would interact with the website. 
                This process has helped us synthesize features we believe to be important in informing our website design process later on.

            <p class="subsection-title">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS AND MOOD BOARDS</p>
            <p class="section-description">
                The Che Cafe is a space that serves many different purposes so we chose to examine websites of spaces that offered those varying services.
                We analyzed competitors on brand, functionality, content, site architecture/navigation, and design.
                We also created mood boards with color schemes, key phrases, and images for the client to choose from.
                We presented our work to the client and recieved feedback on their preferences and priorities.

            <p class="subsection-title">CREATIVE BRIEF</p>
            <p class="section-description">
                We distilled the data we gathered from our user research and client conversations into objectives that informed our website structure. 
                We drafted a low resolution wireframe for mobile first, as websites are increasingly being accessed on mobile devices.

            <p class="subsection-title">PROTOTYPES AND USER TEST</p>
            <p class="section-description">
                We implemented functionality into our wireframe by creating low-fidelity prototypes for both mobile and desktop.
                We created two scenarios for a user test which allowed us to get beneficial early-stage feedback.

            <p class="subsection-title">CRITIQUE AND REVISIONS</p>
            <p class="section-description">
                Using what we learned from our user test, we made appropriate design changes in our high fidelity prototypes. 
                We exchanged critiques with another design team and made a list of revisions to our prototypes.

            <p class="subsection-title">USER TESTING AND CLIENT FEEDBACK</p>
            <p class="section-description">
                After iterating our prototypes from the critiques, we conducted 3 more user tests. 
                The tests informed further changes to our work. 
                We took this newest version to our client to get their feedback.
                Synthesizing recommendations, we produced our final product.
